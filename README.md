# Juliet

**Junctive Unstructured Learning for Incrementally Evolving Transformers**

Juliet is an experimental AI framework built for **incremental, evolutionary learning**.
Unlike static models that freeze after training, Juliet creates a **living ecosystem of isomorphic entities (isos)** — lightweight transformer-based learners that grow, adapt, and evolve over time.

Each iso maintains its own **persistent memory** (via vector stores) and ingests unstructured data from conversations, documents (`.pdf`, `.txt`, etc.), or other sources. Over time, isos fine-tune **lightweight adapters** on their unique history, giving rise to divergent traits, behaviors, and emergent intelligence.

Juliet goes beyond conventional RAG pipelines — it’s a **wild evolutionary soup of transformers**, where memory, state-space dynamics, and perturbations converge to produce creative and adaptive learning.
